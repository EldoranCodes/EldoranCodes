# **John Leonard Salinas**

I work with Java, fix old systems, and try to understand how things actually work under the hood. Most of my projects here come from real issues I run into while modernizing legacy Java EE apps or experimenting with Spring Boot.

I’m still early in my career, but I enjoy the process of breaking things, fixing them, and figuring out why they broke in the first place. That’s the part that makes me better.

I use Neovim and Arch Linux mainly because they don’t let you get lazy — you have to know what you’re doing, and I like that.

Most of my repos are small services, backend experiments, or rewrites of features I’ve built at work. Nothing fancy. Just real problems I tried solving.

Right now I’m focusing on:

* cleaning up my Java fundamentals
* structuring services properly
* understanding Spring Boot beyond annotations
* making my code easier to maintain

That’s pretty much it. I’m just building stuff and learning as I go.
